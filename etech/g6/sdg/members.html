            <h2 class="article-title" style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 20px!important;">Balagasay, Genevieve</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">From all the SDG goals that&nbsp;are universal goals for all people and are inherently global in nature, set of universal goals that would aid in combating the world's urgent environmental, political, and economic challenges.<br><br>To be honest at first I had a hard time participating in this kind of activity as a group because I never done an website making before, even way back on my junior high days. It was challenging because I never done this and quite fun because we do a teamwork just to build up this kind of project. Now I can say that learning about these initiatives helps us students develop insights into critical issues around the world. The SDG that we chose which is the SDG 16 aims to improve people's lives by reducing violence, improving access to justice, and promoting effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions. And to promotes the development of the knowledge, skills, understanding, values and actions required to create a sustainable world, which ensures environmental protection and conservation, promotes social equity and encourages economic sustainability. This will helps us all to be in a good society in the near future.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that in this advocacy it can and will&nbsp; Reduce all forms of violence and related death rates across the board. Stop child abuse, exploitation, trafficking, and all forms of violence and torture against children. Promote the rule of law at the national and international levels, and ensure that everyone has equal access to justice. For everyone’s freedom and healthy society we must promote a advocacy like this, for the near future of the society.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout this course, I have learned how technology has changed and evolved over time through history. Today the internet provides us the opportunity to participate, express creativity, and connect globally through mainstream media also google is very important because it is also easy to use and has a wide variation of sources to get you information. If you compare google to manually flipping through books in a library like people did before technology was widely used, it would have taken a lot of time and effort to scour through all of those to get the information that you specifically need.</p>
            <h2 class="article-title" style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 20px!important;">Hernandez, Khim</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">I understand that SDG 16 aims to improve people's lives by reducing violence, improving access to justice, and promoting effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions.<br><br>I realized that SDG 16 is important to society because<br>SDG 16 intends peaceful and inclusive societies based on respect for human rights, the protection of the most vulnerable, the rule of law and good governance at all levels.<br><br>While doing our activity I realized why we need to promote peace education;<br>Peace education aspires to enable students to become responsible citizens who are open to differences, capable of empathy and solidarity, both within and across borders and social groups, and who can deconstruct the foundations of violence and take action to advance the prospects of peace.</p>
            <h2 class="article-title" style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 20px!important;">Cruzat, Karel</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">When we made the website, there was a lot of planning and suggestions before it was created, I'm happy of course there are people who are nervous because we might not be able to finish it right away but it disappeared right away and I can say that the advocacy we did helped me especially for women like me who also have I learned knowledge such as how you can avoid dangerous situations, and I can say to my group members, good job to everyone because they did their best to make the outcome of our activities beautiful and orderly even though there were glitches but that It will be fixed soon. If there is something that didn't help much, it's okay to give it another chance because it's a shame and the important thing I learned is to be understanding with the people you are with in your group and don't be angry because it won't bring anything good to all of you.</p>
